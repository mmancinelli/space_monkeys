## Description
For CS171, we found and cleaned data from two locations (Kaggle's All Rocket Launches since 1957 and USC Satellite Database) to analyze and present a story regarding the history of the space industry. We concluded that in addition to the Space Race Age (1957-1975), there are two other defining ages of the space industry: The Exploration Age (1976-2011), which ended when the last Space Shuttle was flown, and the Commercialization Age (2012-Present), which is demarcated by the skyrocketing contributions of SpaceX as well as movement towards space tourism by Virgin Galactic and Blue Origins.
